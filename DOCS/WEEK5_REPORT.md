# REPORT
We were unable to get the current sensor to work this week. The current values being printed weren't changing, even when we moved the servos fast, and under load.

We did connect a multimeter in series with the current sensor, and it did show the current spikes, and the general changes, which suggested there was an issue with the ADC pin on the MCU, but we're still not sure.

We will try to use the current sensor on an Audrino, which will help us determine if the issue is with the MCU, the code, or something else.

Once we figure out the issue, the final code will be put up
