# REPORT
This week we were able to complete the code, and it looked like it should work, but we could not program the MCU or test the code, due to issues with the ST-LINK firmware not being the most updated, and our computers could not update it.

We used STM32CubeProgrammer to download the LED code to the MCU, but even that stopped working after a while.

We also discovered that for the serial printing, we would need a seperate USB to TTL converter, which we didn't have, so we will need to wait to test that as well, but the code shouldn't change.
