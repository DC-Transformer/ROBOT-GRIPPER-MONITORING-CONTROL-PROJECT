# REPORT
This week we were able to complete the code, and it looked like it should work, but we could not program it due to issues with the ST-LINK firmware not being the most updated, and our computers could not update it.

We also discovered that for the serial printing, we would need a seperate USB to TTL converter, but that didn't change the code
