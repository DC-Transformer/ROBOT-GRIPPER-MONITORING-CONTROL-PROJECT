# REPORT
The professor was able to update the ST-LINK on her computer, and after that we were able to test the week 2 code, and confirm that it worked as expected

At this point we didn't have the current sensors to work with, so we used a temperature sensor for now, but we will have to redo week 3 to use the current sensor
