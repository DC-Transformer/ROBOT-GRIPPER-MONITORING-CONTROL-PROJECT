# REPORT
The professor was able to update the ST-LINK on her computer, and after that we were able to test the week 2 LED BLINK and SERIAL code, and confirm that it worked as expected.

At this point we didn't have the current sensors to work with, so we used a temperature sensor for now, and it worked for the baremetal and RTOS versions.

We will have to redo week 3 to use the current sensor, but based on initial research, it should be straight forward, and the code should be a lot simpler than the temperature sensor. The final code and results on Github will be with the current sensor, once we get it to work, but until then we will only put the Temperature sensor code on Github.
