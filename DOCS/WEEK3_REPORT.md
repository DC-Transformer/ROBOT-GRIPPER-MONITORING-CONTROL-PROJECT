# REPORT
The professor was able to update the ST-LINK on her computer, and after that we were able to test the week 2 LED BLINK and SERIAL code, and confirm that it worked as expected.

At this point we didn't have the current sensors to work with, so we used a temperature sensor for now, and it worked for the baremetal and RTOS versions.

We will have to redo week 3 to use the current sensor, but based on initial research, it should be straight forward, and the code should be a lot simpler than the temperature sensor.
