# REPORT
We were able to get the code to run 2 tasks at once, and we were able to see it switching between tasks.

We also received the current sensors, so we can redo week 3 and week 4 to use those sensors instead of the temperature sensor we've been using as a placeholder.

The final code uploaded here will be with the current sensor, once we get it to work.
