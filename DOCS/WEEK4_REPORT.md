# REPORT
We received the current sensors, so we can redo week 3 and week 4 to use those sensors instead of the temperature sensor we've been using as a placeholder.

We didn't get to work on the week 4 lab, since the tutorial we originally planned to follow didn't work, so we had to do more research to figure out how to get it to work.

The final code and results uploaded here will be with the current sensor, once we get it to work.
